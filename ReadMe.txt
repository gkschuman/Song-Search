I wrote the code for SongSearch.h and SongSearch.cpp. The program's output gives the amount of RAM that my data structures took up as well as the CPU time it took to go through all of the sample user input's in the Requests text file.

I was provided with:
	All the files except the makefile, SongSearch.cpp, and SongSearch.h

To run:
	1. Compile using the provided make file.
	2. Use one of the sample Requests files, such as Requests-1000-3.txt
